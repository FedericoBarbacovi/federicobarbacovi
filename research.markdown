# nChain

At nChain I have focused mainly on zkSNARKs and their implementations.
The first project I worked on was the implementation in Bitcoin Script of the Groth16 verifier.
The results appeared in the following paper:

- **Practical Implementation of Pairing-Based zkSNARK in Bitcoin Script**, with Enrique Larraia, Paul Germouty, Wei Zhang, published in the *8th International Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology*, [ePrint:2024/1498](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1498).

The code supporting the paper (and more) is available in the GitHub repository [zkScript](https://github.com/nchain-innovation/zkscript_package).

# PhD

During my PhD, I studied geometric problems through the lenses of homological algebra.
In other words, I studied the shape of geometric objects (locally) defined by polynomial equations

$$f_i(z_1, \dots, z_n) = 0$$

by looking at various algebraic gadgets attached to them (the focus mainly being on the derived category $D^b(X)$).

Below is a list the papers I wrote during my PhD:

- **Spherical twists, relations and the center of autoequivalence groups of K3 surfaces**, with Kohei Kikuta, [arXiv:2210.00228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00228).

- **Serre functors of residual categories via hybrid models**, with Ed Segal, published in [Bull. LMS](https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1112/blms.12878), [arXiv:2205.04793](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04793).

- **On Gromov-Yomdin type theorems and a categorical interpretation of holomorphicity**, with Jongmyeong Kim, published in [Selecta Mathematica](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00029-023-00870-x), Volume 29, article number 65, (2023), [arXiv:2110.12597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12597).

- **Entropy of the composition of two spherical twists**, with Jongmyeong Kim, published in [Osaka Math Journal](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/osaka-journal-of-mathematics/volume-60/issue-3/Entropy-of-the-composition-of-two-spherical-twists/5651ojm.full), Vol 60 No. 3 (July 2023), [arXiv:2107.06079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06079).

- **Spherical functors and the flop-flop autoequivalence**,<sup>[1](#footnote)</sup> [arXiv:2007.14415](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14415).

- **On the composition of two spherical twists**,<sup>[1](#footnote)</sup> published in [IMRN](https://academic.oup.com/imrn/article-abstract/2023/20/17270/6748177), [arXiv:2006.06016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06016).
